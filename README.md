# password-generator

FOR THIS PROJECT I WAS SUPPOSED TO MAKE A PASSWORD GENERATOR THAT PROMPTED THE USER TO ENTER THE NUMBER OF CHARACTERS THEY WANTED TO USE AND ALSO ASK IF THEY WANTED TO INCLUDE UPPERCASE, LOWERCASE, NUMBERS, AND SPECIAL CHARACTERS WHEN CLICK THE "GENERATE PASSWOR" BUTTON.

I GOT IT TO PROMPT, AND I USED MATH.FLOOR AND MATH.RANDOM TO SELECT A RANDOM INDEX FROM ARRAYS.
I GOT IT TO RETURN THE VALUES FROM THOSE ARRAYS.

I STILL NEED TO ADD IF ELSE STATEMENTS SO THAT WHEN A PROMPT EQUALS FALSE THEN THAT ARRAY VALUE IS IGNORED AND DOES NOT RETURN IN THE BROWSER. (I THINK THAT'S HOW THAT WORKS)
I STILL NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE A FOR LOOP TO CONTINUE PICKING RANDOM VALUES FROM THE SELECTED ARRAYS UNTIL THERE ARE ENOUGH CHARACTERS BASED ON THE USER INPUT.

I DO PLAN ON SUBMITTING THIS AGAIN ONCE COMPLETED FOR A BETTER GRADE.
